# Song-Lyric-Generator
This project finetunes GPT-2-simple on song lyric data (via Kaggle) to generate song lyrics. `final_gpt_lyric_samples` contains the generated lyrics 
once GPT-2-simple was finished finetuning. The notebook (`songlyrics_gpt (1).ipynb`) prints out generated lyrics after each 25 iterations of finetuning.


I also designed and trained an RNN with TensorFlow to generate song lyrics, but some of the code was taken from a homework assignment for one of my classes, so I am not putting it publicly on GitHub to be safe.
